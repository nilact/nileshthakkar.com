As i said in my last post, I’ll write about how to generate Nested Gridview dynamically. As there are many articles available on the net, let me provide you the link to the article that i referred.

[Gridview Control to show master-child or master-slave data](http://progtalk.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleID=54)  

It provides detail explanation with snapshot. There is one disadvantage that Gridview control is available only on client side. It means if you want to perform some action on server side like you want to get child controls Gridview then it’s not possible.

I hope this helps!!  
Enjoy!! :)
