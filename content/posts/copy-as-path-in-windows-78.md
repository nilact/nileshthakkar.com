Many times we want to copy complete file path and we do that in two steps:  

*   Copy path of the folder/drive in which file resides
*   Copy Filename

and use combination of it to solve the purpose.  
  
One simple solution exists from win 7 onwards is to select file and press Shift key + Right Mouse click. Context menu will have an option “Copy as path”, select it and you’re done.
