Some of my friend reported that they can’t use [ASPX Edit Helper](http://ardentdev.com/aspxedithelper/) with VS 2010 and from the original post it is evident that it works great with VS 2005 and VS 2008.

But one of the guy added support for VS 2010 using original souce code. You can download the latest source and binaries (with latest bug fixes) [here](http://www.rowlandoconnor.com/2010/04/16/aspx-edit-add-in-for-visual-studio-2010/) and if you’d like to change something, of course you can as source code is available.
