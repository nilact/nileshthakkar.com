If you don’t like your desktop covered with so many icons and still want to open your favourite program with ease then Mouse Extender (ME) is the best option for you. I’ve been using it for quite a long time at my home as well as office. You can download it from [CodePlex](http://me.codeplex.com/).  
  
ME is based on WPF and requires .Net Framework 3.5 sp1 to be installed. If you’ve .Net framework installed then it’s good but if not then you can check minimum installation you need [here](http://www.hanselman.com/smallestdotnet/).  
  
You can configure it as per your need and if you want to know what features it provides then just go through this [link](http://mouseextender.net/features/).  
  
Happy Programming :)
