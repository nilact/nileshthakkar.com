SSMS Tools Pack, I downloaded this free Add-in 3 weeks ago, and I am glad that I did that. Below are the few features that I’ve been using so far :

*   SQL Snippets
*   Format SQL
*   New Query Template
*   CRUD Generation
*   Regions and Debug sections

You can check out more useful features [here](http://www.ssmstoolspack.com/Features) and you can download it [here](http://www.ssmstoolspack.com/Download).

This add-in makes life easier with its number of features that are missing from SSMS.

Hope you like it and have fun!
