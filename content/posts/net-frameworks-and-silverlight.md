Friends as I said that I will post  about topics that often surfaces on Asp.net Forums as well as Orkut Communities. So here's one of the question I came across:

  

Is it possible to Use SilverLight with Asp.net 2.0?

Answer : No  

  

You can not use it directly with Framework 2.0 but of course you can use it with Framework 3.0 and 3.5. But in a way if you want to use Silverlight with your application developed with framework 2.0 then you just have to compile all the Silverlight files in Framework 3.5 and add reference of it in your application. That's It!!

  

Though it becomes confusing for people when experts say that yes you can do it with Orcas. Just compile your files in Orcas, add them in your application with proper reference. People often wonder what is this Orcas? Orcas is the Codename for .NET Framework 3.5.

  

Here are some Codenames of .NET Frameworks :  

*   Framework  2.0 - Whidbey  
    

*   Framework  3.0 - Vista

*   Framework  3.5 - Orcas

  

Silverlight applications can be written in any .NET programming language. Microsoft has positioned Expression Blend Version 2.0 and 2.5 for designing the UI of Silverlight 1.0 and 2 applications respectively. Silverlight 2.0 is the Latest Version.

  

Mono is a project led by Novell, which provides you with similar kind of IDE of .NET .It can be run on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Solaris, and of course Windows. Latest Version of Mono is 2.2.

  

The same Mono team is developing Moonlight, open source implementation of the Silverlight  1.0 and 2.0 runtimes. This project is officially supported by Microsoft. Lates version of Moonlight is 1.0 that was released on January 20, 2009.

  

Here are two sample application developed in Silvelight..just check them out..
