Those who have been using .NET [Reflector](http://www.reflector.net/), must be knowing that it’s not free anymore. Those who don’t know about Reflector, don’t have to bother much now. You could download dotPeek, an awesome decompiler, which is in the Early Access Program stage. It’s been developed by JetBrains, the maker of Resharper and more developer productivity tools. 

You can check out what its latest build offer [here](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2011/12/dotpeek-is-back-with-new-early-build/) and can download it from [here](http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/NETPEEK/dotPeek+Early+Access+Program).

In this year, there are more posts related to add-ins and tools, but will have more programming problems and their solutions related posts in coming new year. :)
